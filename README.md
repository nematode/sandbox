-Exercise 1-

Write some code that will accept an amount and convert it to the appropriate string representation.
<br>Example: Convert 2523.04 to "Two thousand five hundred twenty-three and 04/100 dollars"


<h3>Notes</h3>
My solution requires Guava--only because I couldn't bring myself to do delimited string concatenation without Joiner. It's bundled in the lib/ folder.
